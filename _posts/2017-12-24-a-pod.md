What's a POD in C++?

POD expands to Plain Object Data. In c++, I can find if the struct I have is a pod or not by type_traits. Do this

`#include <type_traits>`

and then use `std::is_pod<Complex>()`. Assuming Complex is the name of the struct, the above function will tell me if the struct is POD or not. PODs are fully compatible with C. C++ rule is that member variables declared later in a struct must be at a higher address. And this is the case indeed. Note that it's opposite to how the variables in a function are allocated on the stack. The variables declared later are often allocated at lower address because that's how the stack grows (atleast on x86). So a declaration of struct would follow that, i.e., the address of the struct declared after a primitive variable would be at a lower address than the primitive. But when it comes to address of the member variable of the struct, the address of those members would grow towards the higher address.

Surprisingly, if I add a function to
